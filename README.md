# System_utility
Rexx project report that was created by me in Master the mainframe 2019 

Rexx report to show the ability to parse syslog records and to enhance a system utility which generates 
point-in-time system activity reports. The system utility uses REXX and the SDSF interfaces to generate reports.


Make a pds and copy all the datasets into different members and change the dataset name as per yours.

Then run the get----using EX command
